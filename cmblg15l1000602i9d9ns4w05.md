# Intro

This was another quick and simple lab in the Web Security Academy Apprentice learning path. So far these early introductory labs seem almost similar to a CTF exercise. Either that, or past CTF experience is giving me a leg. Honestly I want to get to some harder stuff that will really get me to solving more complex problems. I also should know better, and be careful what I wish for…

# The Lab

This lab has an unprotected admin panel that needs to be found. The goal of this lab is to delete a user named Carlos.

# The Analysis

These are the steps I took to analyse and solve this lab.

1. Based on the reading preceding the lab, the first thing I did was append:
    
    ```plaintext
    /robots.txt
    ```
    
    to the URL of the labs web page. This returned this result:

2. That looks like the path to an admin panel to me, so I also appended that to the labs web page URL:

    and it was exactly what I thought it was. On the admin panel I can see two users.
    
3. Deleting Carlos solves the lab so Carlos has to go. Sorry Dude, nothing personal…

# What I learned

* Checking a websites robots.txt file could possible yield some clues about potential vulnerabilities.
