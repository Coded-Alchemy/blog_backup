I’ve rolled out my website revamp and had a successful soft launch! It sat for years neglected and fading into obscurity. I wanted to brush the dust off it and breathe new life into it. Based on the feedback, it seems that its been received well with the small audience that has been privy to it so far. I plan to add more content soon, Im always my own worst critic.

The Coded Alchemy website is actually and web app. Its written in React and uses React Router as its framework. I picked up React a few years back, but never really did anything meaningful with it. I think I’ve laid the groundwork with modern technologies to future proof the development stack for a good while, but honestly, I don’t keep up with web technologies as much as I do with other technologies.

It was fun to get back into web app development, and I look forward to having something I can extend and build out further in that realm. Im mostly known for Android development, but I have talent in other areas.

There will be a more public launch of the website in the future, Ill bring more details, stay tuned!
