I was scrolling LinkedIn, and saw a post from [Dr. Natalie Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nataliefosterjohnson_cybersecurity-for-students-activity-7334346227406266368-M_Ix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAOrSMABW98aB5IRWmxgcMiZ0Dr1JUcA04M), about the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies(NICCS) updated cyber career profiles. So I followed [the link in her post](https://niccs.cisa.gov/audience/cybersecurity-students) to find a visual representation of the career profiles and noticed software engineer displayed.

I already was aware of the security aspects involved with software development, but I still considered myself as pivoting into cyber security. I think I should re-frame past experience to reflect this as I move forward.

Im not actually changing careers, more like changing focus. I might have to update my resume again…
