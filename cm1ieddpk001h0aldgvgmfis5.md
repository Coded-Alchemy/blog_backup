I’m going into cybersecurity, I’ve made up my mind, that’s it, that’s what it is! I guess if you're reading this you either know who I am, or don’t, there is a 50/50 chance either way. So for those that don’t know, allow me to introduce myself.

My name is Taji Abdullah, for the past score less 6 years or so I’ve been a software engineer by profession. I specialized in developing applications for the Android operating system. I loved what I did and it was my passion for many years. It still is if I’m being honest with myself, but I felt it time to change things up.

I have had an underlying interest in cybersecurity that I’ve never really indulged in until relatively recently. Earlier this year(2024) I enrolled in Googles Cybersecurity course. I since have completed and earned its certification.

I’m currently studying for the Comptia Security+ exam and working on gaining hands on experience in the cybersecurity realm. I decided to create this blog to document my journey and lessons learned. Im looking forward to progressing in this field, pivoting away from software development as my main focus. I know some skills transfer over and Im also looking forward to discovering how past experience helps me gain new experience.

LFG!
