I was studying for the Security+ exam when I received a notification from Ryan Montgomery's YouTube channel. He had just released a video about TryHackMe's event, the Advent of Cyber 2024. Curious, I switched from Professor Messor over to Ryan's channel to see what was going on. It was a video explaining and detailing the Advent of Cyber(AoC) and also a walk through of the first days challenge.

As I watched the the video, I thought it seemed like a fun event to join. I already had a TryHackMe account so all I needed to do was joint the AoC 2024 room. This would be my first cyber security event so I definitely was excited to get started.

The AoC 2024 theme is, festive beginner friendly exercises that take place every day up till Christmas starting December 1st. There are a lot of cool prizes and a raffle to win them. Raffle tickets are acquired by answering questions all through the event, the more questions answered, the more tickets won for winning prizes. There is also a certification and badge awarded for completing the event.

AoC 2024 also provides a 30% of TryHackMe's VIP subscription. Previously I began a learning path on the free tier and bumped up against a paid room that blocked me from completing it fully. So with this discount, after the AoC event I will be able to continue the learning path I already started and be able to complete that and earn its certification as well.

I definitely am enjoying my cyber security learning journey and I think things are lining up rather nicely so far!
